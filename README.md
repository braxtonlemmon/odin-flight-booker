# Odin Flight Booker Project
Ruby on Rails project focusing on building advanced forms.
From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav)

The goal of this project is to create an application that allows a user to search for one-way flights based on a specific date. The user can then enter the information for all the passengers included in the booking. A user then enters the billing information and finalizes the booking.
